# 📡 BLE STACK VULNERABILITY MAPPING

This document specifies the interaction between **SPECTER STRIKE** and the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Controller Stack.

### 1. PHYSICAL LAYER (PHY) INTERACTION
- **Frequency:** 2.4 GHz ISM Band (2402 MHz to 2480 MHz).
- **Modulation:** GFSK (Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying).
- **Exploit:** Utilizing 40 Channels (3 Advertising, 37 Data) for adaptive frequency hopping interference.

### 2. LINK LAYER (LL) ATTACK VECTORS
- **Packet Structure:** `| Preamble (1) | Access Address (4) | PDU (2-257) | CRC (3) |`
- **Injection Point:** Direct PDU (Protocol Data Unit) manipulation to bypass standard Link Layer state machines.
- **State Hijacking:** Forcing the target device from `STANDBY` to `CONNECTION_STATE` via malformed `CONNECT_IND` packets.

### 3. ATTRIBUTE PROTOCOL (ATT) & GATT LEAKAGE
- **Exploit Type:** Handle Enumeration.
- **Method:** Automated crawling of 16-bit and 128-bit UUIDs to identify non-advertised services.
