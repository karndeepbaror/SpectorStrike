# 📂 DIRECTORY: TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS (SPECS)
> **STATUS:** `LEVEL-4 ENCRYPTED DATA` | **TYPE:** `PROTOCOL INTELLIGENCE`
> 

## 🛰️ OVERVIEW
Welcome to the **Specter Strike Technical Core**. This directory contains the raw engineering specifications and protocol-level logic that powers the **Phantom-BLE-Engine**. Unlike standard tools, these modules are built on deep-level signal analysis and OS-specific vulnerability research.
