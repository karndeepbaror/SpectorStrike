## 📊 VULNERABILITY SPECTRUM
```
pie title TARGET VULNERABILITY DISTRIBUTION
    "Apple Proximity Handshake" : 35
    "Android Fast Pair Protocol" : 30
    "Windows Swift Pair" : 20
    "IoT Generic BLE Services" : 15
```

## 🛡️ RESEARCH OBJECTIVES
• **Zero-Day Identification:** Identifying undocumented behaviors in proprietary BLE stacks.               
• **Entropy Analysis:** Analyzing packet randomness to bypass OS-level filtering.          
• **Signal Fingerprinting:** Developing methods to identify devices even when MAC Randomization is active.

## ⚠️ CLASSIFIED INFORMATION
The data within this directory is the result of thousands of packet-injection cycles. Unauthorized modification of the Fingerprint DB may lead to `Ghost-Positive` results and operational failure.
