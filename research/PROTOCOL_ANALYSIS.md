# 🔬 BLE PROTOCOL STACK ANALYSIS

### 🛰️ L2CAP Layer Manipulation
Specter Strike targets the Logical Link Control and Adaptation Protocol (L2CAP) to inject malformed connection parameters. 

### 🔐 SMP (Security Manager Protocol)
Our research focuses on the "Just Works" pairing mechanism vulnerability, where 128-bit TK (Temporary Key) values are set to zero, allowing for intercept-less service mapping.

### 📡 Advertisement Interval Optimization
For maximum strike efficiency, the tool uses an adaptive interval of 20ms to 100ms, ensuring the target device's radio is constantly engaged.
